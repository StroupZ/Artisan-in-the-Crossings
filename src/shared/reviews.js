        description: `ARTISAN in the Crossings is THE PLACE for excellence in state-of-the-art medical esthetic treatments. Having been Jenn's client for 3 years, I'm delighted that she's gone out on her own and has a gorgeous new office in The Crossings. I trust as her as a professional- an asthetic nurse injector, an artist who works magic, and as my friend. Jenn blends the art and science of esthetics beautifully. I trust her implicitly. Always friendly, caring, informative and gentle, she's earned my highest recommendation. Jenn helps me to look and feel my best, and I'm sure that you will be pleased too!`,

        description: "I have been seeing Jennifer for my skin care concerns for many years now. I have lived in many resort cities going to spas and actually being a retired spa owner myself, I needed a skilled, experienced, professional which I found in Jen. She listens to your concerns, makes you feel comfortable and gives you the answers you need. She has always taken the time to explain services so you can make decisions and know the expectations of treatments. I actually believe shes one of the best and would absolutely recommend her. Thanks Jen!",
